# LSRE-ReleasePlanningProject
Requirements for a Course Management System. Please check the issue tracker.

# TODO (week 46)

## Requirements Quality
As you notice, the quality of these requirements vary quite a bit. Your first job is to -- by adding comments to the issues -- clarify them so that they can be understood.

## Dependencies
The next part is to identify any dependencies between requirements. There are quite a number of dependencies here. Comment on the issues and relate them to each other (using #issue-number to link them)

## Requirements abstraction level
Some requirements are huge, others are small. Make sure that you break down the huge ones into smaller requirements (into features and components of those features). Make sure that the small requirements are linked to larger requirements.

## More Features
Invent more features, add corresponding issues.
