# LSRE-ReleasePlanningProject
Requirements for a Course Management System. Please check the issue tracker.

# Week 47-48

## TODO

- Decide on an area of responsibility for each of you (use the course discussion forum for this).
- Assign responsibles for each issue according to what you have decided.
- Link the requirements to each other, along with comments on *how* they are linked.
- Tag Requirements (assign labels) so we know whether they are bugfixes, feature requests, or whether we should not be working with them.

## Next Step
By the second half of week 48, we should have discussed on the course discussion forum what prioritisation method to use, how to apply it in this particular case, and how to do release planning based on this.

## Don't forget:
Your reflective logs on this assignment are still empty. How does what you do here connect to research literature?

# TODO (Week 50)
## Assignment Reflection

## Assign issues to users
Take ownership of an area and assign all issues related to that area to yourself.

## Prioritisation

- Decide on Prioritisation Method
- Decide on which Perspectives to prioritise against
- Conduct the prioritisation

## Assign issues to milestones (according to the prioritisation)

## Assign labels to issues
... and review the current labels. Setting the "Clarification" label on all requirements is meaningless. Classify them instead as features, bugs, critical bugs, minor improvements, etc.

## Continue working with requirements quality, dependencies, and abstraction level

## Remaining issues

- Requirements Prioritisation. Which methods exist? What are their pros and cons? Which can be used in this assignment? Why? How?
- Requirements Prioritisation. Which criteria should we prioritise against?
- Roadmapping. How should we do it? Discuss different methods and their pros and cons. Decide on which to use in this course, and why.
- Roadmapping. Actually create a roadmap for the product. Set up milestones, and assign issues to the milestones.
- Research Literature: What research literature have you found that can help you with this release planning assignment? Discuss on It's Learning.
- Finding Features. What methods can we use to find more features? Discuss on It's Learning. Describe in further detail (with references to scientific works) in your reflective log.
- Finding Features. Actually execute the methods you decide upon and create issues for the features thusly acquired.
- Dependencies between requirements. How do dependencies between requirements affect the prioritisation? What can we do about that?

# TODO (week 48)
## **NOT_DONE** Assignment Reflection
So far, none of you have started relating what we do here with research literature and/or your own experiences. Start writing your running log of the release planning assignment, add brief summaries of relevant papers and your reflections on how they apply to the practical work we do here.

## **NOT_COMPLETED** Continue working with requirements quality, dependencies, and abstraction level
Fix the existing requirements. Add the missing requirements. Link the requirments. Break down and work up the requirements (with links) so that you cover all levels from goals to code level.

## **NOT_COMPLETED** Continue inventing more features and issues.
There are some embryos to new features in your comments already. Take the full step and create new issues for them.

## **NEW** Assign Responsibles
Assign yourself as responsible to the requirements that you have been working the most with. When you create new requirements you should also assign yourself as responsible for them -- unless you are obviously creating sub-requirements where someone else is owner of the main requirement.

## **NEW** Classify the Requirements
Use the Labels and classify the requirements. Are they feature requests, bug fixes, clarifications of other requirements, duplicates to other requirements (please make sure you understand the difference between a clarification and a duplicate), or something else. Create new labels if you need to.

## **NEW** Add Size and Value Estimates
Can we do this at all on GitHub? Discuss this on in the course Discussion Forum on It's Learning.

## Remaining issues
Things you should have done, but which I have not seen evidence of yet. Discuss these on It's Learning.

# TODO (week 44-45)

## Requirements Quality
As you notice, the quality of these requirements vary quite a bit. Your first job is to -- by adding comments to the issues -- clarify them so that they can be understood.

## Dependencies
The next part is to identify any dependencies between requirements. There are quite a number of dependencies here. Comment on the issues and relate them to each other (using #issue-number to link them)

## Requirements abstraction level
Some requirements are huge, others are small. Make sure that you break down the huge ones into smaller requirements (into features and components of those features). Make sure that the small requirements are linked to larger requirements.

## More Features
Invent more features, add corresponding issues.
